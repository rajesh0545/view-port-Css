   <div class="int">Browser</div>
    <p>For the most part, browsers are considered single threaded. 
        For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, 
        from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, with ensuring the
         main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to 
         handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of
          the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate</p>
      <div class="int">
          <p>Latency is our main threat to overcome to ensure a fast load. To be fast to load, the developers
            ' goals include sending requested information as fast as possible, or at least seem super fast.
             Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over-the-air to computers.
